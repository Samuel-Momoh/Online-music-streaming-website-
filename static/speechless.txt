[00:01.25] Your love is magical, that's how I feel
[00:08.43] But I have not the words here to explain
[00:15.98] Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
[00:20.42] But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
[00:25.21] To tell you how I feel
[00:29.93] But I am speechless, speechless
[00:38.42] That's how you make me feel
[00:41.66] Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
[00:48.45] When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
[00:55.21] My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
[01:02.68] Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
[01:09.94] Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
[01:16.40] When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
[01:24.53] It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
[01:31.47] Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
[01:38.44] Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
[01:45.41] I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
[01:52.00] There's no mountain high I cannot climb
[01:57.04] I'm humbled in your grace
[01:59.24] Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
[02:06.71] Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
[02:14.00]Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
[02:20.87]Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
[02:28.64]Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
[02:35.13]Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
[02:42.61]Speechless your love is magical, that's how I feel
[02:58.25]But in your presence I am lost for words
[03:03.10]Words like, "I love you."
